.Sh NAME
.Nm wincent-strings-util
.Nd merge localizable strings files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar -base Ar basepath       \" -base path
.Op Fl merge Ar mergepath   \" [-merge path]
.Op Fl output Ar outputpath \" [-output path] 
.br
.Nm
.Ar -info Ar plistpath      \" -info path
.Ar -strings Ar stringspath \" -strings path
.Op Fl output Ar outputpath \" [-output path]
.Sh DESCRIPTION             \" Section Header - required
In its first mode of operation
.Nm
reads the localizable strings file,  
.Ar basepath ,
parses its contents looking for valid key/value pairs, and writes out the parsed content. If a second localizable strings file,
.Ar mergepath ,
is specified then
.Nm
merges values from
.Ar mergepath
into the output. By default the result is written to standard output but it can be directed to a specific file by passing an appropriate
.Ar outputpath .
Comments in 
.Ar basepath 
are preserved in the output.
.Pp
In its second mode of operation
.Nm
reads the plist file,
.Ar plistpath
(usually an Info.plist file), and uses its key/value pairs as a basis for performing macro substitution within the strings file, 
.Ar stringspath .
Any key name in the strings file delimited using double angle quotation marks (Unicode 0x00ab and 0x00bb) will be substituted using the corresponding value from the property list file. This mode of operation is intended to supplement the "Info.plist preprocessing" feature of Xcode. If an 
.Ar outputpath
is specified then the results are written to that file; otherwise they are written to standard output.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width -indent  
.It Fl base                 
Read localizable strings file
.Ar basepath .
.It Fl merge
(Optional) merge with localizable strings file
.Ar mergepath .
Key/value pairs in 
.Ar mergepath
override key/value pairs in 
.Ar basepath .
.It Fl output
(Optional) write output to localizable strings file
.Ar outputpath ,
creating it if necessary. If 
.Ar outputpath
already exists any previous content will be replaced.
.It Fl info
Read the plist file 
.Ar plistpath .
.It Fl strings
Perform macro substitution on the strings file 
.Ar stringspath .
.El                      \" Ends the list
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.Ss Merging algorithm
The following actions are taken depending on whether a key is present only in
.Ar basepath ,
only in
.Ar mergepath ,
or in both:
.Bl -ohang
.It Sy Key is present in basepath and mergepath
The output will use the key from
.Ar basepath
and the value from
.Ar mergepath .
.It Sy Key is present in basepath but not mergepath
The output will use the key and the value from
.Ar basepath ,
and a warning that the key was missing from
.Ar mergepath
will be printed to standard error.
.It Sy Key is present in mergepath but not basepath
The key and value will be omitted from the output and a warning that the key was not present in
.Ar basepath
will be printed to standard error.
.El
.Pp
In all cases, comments from 
.Ar basepath
will be carried across into the output, but comments from
.Ar mergepath
will not.
.Sh ERRORS
On encountering a malformed localizable strings file
.Nm
will print a description of the parse error to standard error and exit with an exit code of 1.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example takes an updated English language strings file containing new key/value pairs,
.Ar en.lproj/Localizable.strings ,
and creates a new Spanish language strings file,
.Ar es.lproj/Localizable.strings ,
merging previously translated key/value pairs from the same Spanish language file into the output:
.Pp
.Dl "wincent-strings-util -base en.lproj/Localizable.strings \e\ "
.Dl "                     -merge es.lproj/Localizable.strings \e\ "
.Dl "                     -output es.lproj/Localizable.strings"
.Pp
The updated output directly updates the original localized Spanish file, overwriting it.
.Pp
The following example takes an unlocalized property list file,
.Ar Info.plist ,
and uses its key/value pairs as a basis for substitution in the localized strings file,
.Ar en.lproj/InfoPlist.strings :
.Pp
.Dl "wincent-strings-util -info Info.plist \e\ "
.Dl "                     -strings en.lproj/InfoPlist.strings"
.Pp
For example, any instances of the string,
.Ar CFBundleVersion ,
in the strings file when surrounding by double-angle quotation marks will be substituted with the value that corresponds to the 
.Ar CFBundleVersion 
key in the property list.

.Sh BUGS
.Nm
may not perform macro substitution in the case where a previous build has been completed and the destination strings file,
.Ar outputpath ,
is already in place in the target build directory. This is because Xcode leaves the processed files in place after building and will not replace them during subsequent builds unless the equivalent files under the source root have changed. As a consequence, the files will not get updated when they are subsequently processed because the macros will already have been substituted on a previous build; this means that the information in the files may not reflect the latest available information. The only workaround is to perform a "Clean" or "Clean All" in order to force Xcode to replace these files.
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
is a derivative work based on 
.Ar stringsUtil
by Omni Development available from
.Ad http://www.omnigroup.com/ftp/pub/localization/ .
.Pp
The principal, user-visible changes in the derived work are:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
Works with InfoPlist.strings files (which use unquoted key strings).
.It
InfoPlist.strings file preprocessing (analogous to Xcode's Info.plist preprocessing feature).
.It
Always writes output files using UTF-16 encoding (the required encoding for strings files).
.It
Catches exceptions when parsing malformed strings files rather than exiting uncleanly (which would cause the Mac OS X CrashReporter to launch).
.It
Emits warnings when keys are present in 
.Ar mergepath
but not
.Ar basepath .
.It
Is a Universal Binary (runs natively on both PowerPC and Intel processors).
.It
Emits a non-zero exit code if writing to output file fails.
.It
Includes this man page.

.Pp
The first public release of 
.Nm
took place on February 19, 2006. The latest version is always available from
